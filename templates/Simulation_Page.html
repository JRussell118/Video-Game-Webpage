	<h1>What is a Simulation Game?</h1>
	<p>Simulation games are one genre of Video Games that focus on recreating an
	event, action, and/or behaviors that you can do in real life. Simulation games
	can give the player the experience of doing an action or behavior without having 
	to use real life resources to perform the same actions in a less stressful
	environment. Some simulator games include farming, building and managing a town,
	or even living a different life entirely. Simulation games can replicate these
	actions as realisitcally as possible, or add a fictional aspect to the game to
	make it more unique than just doing the action in real life. Though some simulation
	games have become more common and mainstream with common behaviors like streaming,
	driving a truck, and even cutting grass.</p>
