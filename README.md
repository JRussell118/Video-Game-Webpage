# Video-Game-Webpage
### This program creates a webpage that has at least 3 pages for the user to navigate.
The program uses the html files in the templates folder and Python's flask library to create a title page listing various types of video games 
with three linked webpages to three video game types. The user is first taken to the account register page to create a username and password to access the webpage. The page checks the complexity of the user's password and reprompts the user if their password has at least one uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number and special character. After an account is created, the username and password is written to the User_Accounts.txt file to allow the user to login with it. The program also logs failed user logins, resets passwords for existing accounts with common passwords, and checks if a new users passwords match any of the passwords from CommonPasswords.txt
